        "body": "Section 508 generally requires Federal agencies to ensure that, when developing, procuring, maintaining, or using information and communication technology, they take into account the needs of all end users, including people with disabilities. Doing so enhances the ability of Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others. Similarly, agency procurement of accessible ICT  enhances the ability of members of the public with disabilities who are seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others. Comparable access is not required if it would impose an 'undue burden' on the agency. If an agency invokes the undue burden exception, the statute requires the information and data to be provided to individuals with disabilities by an alternative means of access."

        "body": "<p>A group of accessibility experts created a training model by manually reviewing about 1,000 federal solicitations and marking each as either compliant or non-compliant.  We parsed the training model, calculated the frequencies of all the unique words, and generated a word count table that contains the frequency of each unique words in every red and green solicitation. Around one million words were identified at the stage. <span>(STEP 1)</span></p><p>Using the <b>Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)</b>, we were able to pre-process/normalize the results of word count table in preparation of identifying the controlled vocabulary and building the classification/prediction model. TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document as well as in the collection or corpus that the document belongs to.  To generate the controlled vocabulary, which serves as critical indicators in the classification model, we used the three sources.  First, for each unique word extracted from the training data set, moderated t-test, false positive rate (FPR) multiple testing methods, etc. are used to determine the similarities of the frequencies in red versus green solicitations.  Second, we conducted empirical testing among Section 508 regulation documents versus other irrelevant documents, and look for the words with significant higher frequencies in the regulation documents. Third, we compared the unique words and the frequency of the words appeared in all the green solicitations versus the irrelevant documents.  Among the results of all three sources, we run through the metrics: <b>{ (1) ∪ { (2) ∩ (3) } }</b> to get the final controlled vocabulary. <span>(STEP 2)</span></p><p>Then we built the prediction model by using the selected best-performance classification algorithm from many which were evaluated by cross-validation <span>(STEP 3)</span>.  The system used the trained prediction model to analyze the solicitation and generate a red or green prediction result for each solicitation posted on sam.gov <span>(STEP 4)</span>.  Section 508 Program Managers go into platform to review the results of all solicitations from his or her agency and provide feedback on the prediction result for the specific solicitation based on his or her manual review. The feedback will become a new training data set to improve the prediction results.  <span>(STEP 5 & 6)</span></p></p>",
