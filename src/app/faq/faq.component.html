        <!--<div class="srt-section-title">About Solicitation Review Tool</div>       -->
        <p>Solicitation Review Tool (SRT) is an automated predictive analysis application that performs scans of the Federal Business Opportunities /FedBizOpps website and delivers: (1) a report containing all of the new solicitations for the previous day; (2) a report of flagged solicitations that require manual review for specific regulatory requirements and compliance; (3) a web-based portal for agency SMEs to perform manual reviews of flagged solicitations and to communicate with contracting POCs for improvement; and (4) analytics and trending of flagged solicitations overtime by agency and government-wide.</p> 
        <p>SRT uses natural language processing, text mining, and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify whether a solicitation contains sufficient compliance requirements for a particular use case (e.g. Section 508 Technical Requirements).

                                    <div class="panel-body">Section 508 generally requires Federal agencies to ensure that, when developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, they take into account the needs of all end users – including people with disabilities. Doing so enhances the ability of Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others. Similarly, agency procurement of accessible ICT/E&IT enhances the ability of members of the public with disabilities who are seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others. Comparable access is not required if it would impose an "undue burden" on the agency. If an agency invokes the undue burden exception, the statute requires the information and data to be provided to individuals with disabilities by an alternative means of access.

                                            A group of accessibility experts created a training model by manually reviewing about 1,000 federal solicitations and marking each as either red or green.  We parsed the training model, calculated the frequencies of all the unique words, and generated a word count table that contains the frequency of each unique words in every red and green solicitation. Around one million words were identified at the stage. <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 1)</span>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Using the <b>TF-IDF</b>, we were able to pre-process/normalize the results of word count table in preparation of identifying the controlled vocabulary and building the classification/prediction model.  Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document as well as in the collection or corpus that the document belongs to.  To generate the controlled vocabulary, which serves as critical indicators in the classification model, we used the three sources.  First, for each unique word extracted from the training data set, moderated t-test, false positive rate (FDR) multiple testing methods, etc. are used to determine the similarities of the frequencies in red versus green solicitations.  Second, we conducted empirical testing among Section 508 regulation documents versus other irrelevant documents, and look for the words with significant higher frequencies in the regulation documents. Third, we compared the unique words and the frequency of the words appeared in all the green solicitations versus the irrelevant documents.  Among the results of all three sources, we run through the metrics: <b>{{metrix}}</b> to get the final controlled vocabulary. <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 2)</span>  
                                        </p>

                                            Then we built the prediction model by using the selected best-performance classification algorithm from many which were evaluated by cross-validation <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 3)</span>.  The system used the trained prediction model to analyze the solicitation and generate a red or green prediction result for each solicitation posted on fedbizopps.gov <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 4)</span>.  Section 508 Coordinators go into platform to review the results of all solicitations from his or her agency and provide feedback on the prediction result for the specific solicitation based on his or her manual review. The feedback will become a new training data set to improve the prediction results.  <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 5 & 6)</span>

Upon identifying the solicitations that need Section 508 adjustments, the system recommends actions to be taken by Section 508 coordinators that will ultimately get to Contracting officers.

                                                    Compliance Board (the "Access Board"), an independent Federal agency, whose primary mission is to promote accessibility for individuals 
                                                    with disabilities. This regulation is referred to as the Access Board’s "standards."

                                        <p>Section 508 refers to a statutory section in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 
                                            (refer to 29 U.S.C. 794d). Congress significantly strengthened Section 508 in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. 
                                            Its primary purpose is to provide access to and use of Federal executive agencies’

                                    <div class="panel-body">Section 508 generally requires Federal agencies to ensure that, when developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, they take into account the needs of all end users – including people with disabilities. Doing so enhances the ability of Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others. Similarly, agency procurement of accessible ICT/E&IT enhances the ability of members of the public with disabilities who are seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others. Comparable access is not required if it would impose an "undue burden" on the agency. If an agency invokes the undue burden exception, the statute requires the information and data to be provided to individuals with disabilities by an alternative means of access.

                                                    <li>set forth some of the exceptions to the requirement to buy ICT that meets the applicable technical provisions (see 36 CFR 1194.3).</li>

                                        <p>No. ICT, like IT, also includes services. For example, some agencies seek to satisfy their desktop computing needs through so-called "seat management" service contracts. Under a seat management arrangement, the contractor provides the software, hardware, and technical support services necessary to support full service desktop computing resources to the agency for a given period of time. Although the agency does not acquire title to the hardware and software, the agency would still need to comply with Section 508 in acquiring desktop computing resources.</p>
                                        <p>As another example, agencies acquiring help desks must ensure that providers are capable of accommodating the communications needs of persons with disabilities, consistent with Subpart D of the Access Board’s standards. An agency help desk may need to communicate through a teletypewriter (TTY) – i.e., equipment that transmits coded signals across a telephone network. The help desk provider must also be familiar with such features as keyboard access and other options important to people with disabilities.    </p>

                                            The Solicitation Review Tool (SRT) was created to assist federal Acquisition employees and Section 508 coordinators on the integration of Section 508 requirements to ICT/E&IT Solicitations issued by the federal government. This way, producing Section 508 compliant technology that fit the needs of all citizens.

                                            The SRT scans ICT/E&IT solicitations posted on FedBizOpps and provide results based on the absence or presence of Section 508 requirements within each scanned solicitation. Upon identifying the solicitations that need Section 508 adjustments, the system recommends actions to be taken by Section 508 coordinators that will ultimately get to Contracting officers.

                                            A group of accessibility experts created a training model by manually reviewing about 1,000 federal solicitations and marking each as either red or green.  We parsed the training model, calculated the frequencies of all the unique words, and generated a word count table that contains the frequency of each unique words in every red and green solicitation. Around one million words were identified at the stage. <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 1)</span>

                                            Using the <b>TF-IDF</b>, we were able to pre-process/normalize the results of word count table in preparation of identifying the controlled vocabulary and building the classification/prediction model.  Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document as well as in the collection or corpus that the document belongs to.  To generate the controlled vocabulary, which serves as critical indicators in the classification model, we used the three sources.  First, for each unique word extracted from the training data set, moderated t-test, false positive rate (FDR) multiple testing methods, etc. are used to determine the similarities of the frequencies in red versus green solicitations.  Second, we conducted empirical testing among Section 508 regulation documents versus other irrelevant documents, and look for the words with significant higher frequencies in the regulation documents. Third, we compared the unique words and the frequency of the words appeared in all the green solicitations versus the irrelevant documents.  Among the results of all three sources, we run through the metrics: <b>{{metrix}}</b> to get the final controlled vocabulary. <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 2)</span>  
                                        </p>

                                            Then we built the prediction model by using the selected best-performance classification algorithm from many which were evaluated by cross-validation <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 3)</span>.  The system used the trained prediction model to analyze the solicitation and generate a red or green prediction result for each solicitation posted on fedbizopps.gov <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 4)</span>.  Section 508 Coordinators go into platform to review the results of all solicitations from his or her agency and provide feedback on the prediction result for the specific solicitation based on his or her manual review. The feedback will become a new training data set to improve the prediction results.  <span style="color: rgb(44, 129, 192)">(STEP 5 & 6)</span>
